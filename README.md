# Pyspark-Diabetes-Dataset

Using the Diabetes dataset from Kaggle, I delved into data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning. Key steps included reading and exploring the dataset, renaming columns for clarity, adding a diabetes indicator column, filtering data for insights, and using Vector Assembler for ML preparation. I trained a linear regression model to predict diabetes outcomes, revealing valuable insights. Next, I plan to visualize results and explore more ML algorithms.
